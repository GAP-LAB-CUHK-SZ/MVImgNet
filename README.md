## üì¢ News
- ‚ùóÔ∏èWe renew the download script to fix (Jul. 8, 2025 UTC):
   - The SharePoint authentication may interrupt the download process.
   - Users can now choose the specific folder to download the MVImgNet. 
- üí™ [MVImgNet2.0](https://github.com/GAP-LAB-CUHK-SZ/MVImgNet2.0) is released! It expands MVImgNet to a total of ~520k real-life objects and 515 categories, and contains ‚àº300k real-world objects in 340+ classes. The annotation comprehensively covers object masks, camera parameters, and point clouds (Feb. 20, 2025 UTC).

## Introduction
This repository is built for:

**MVImgNet**: A Large-scale Dataset of Multi-view Images **(CVPR2023)** [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06042)]

## MVImgNet
MVImgNet contains **6.5 million** frames from **219,188** videos crossing objects from **238** classes. We provide a SharePoint link to download the full data. Please fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfU9BkV1hY3r75n5rc37IvlzaK2VFYbdsvohqPGAjb2YWIbUg/viewform?usp=sf_link) to get the download link and password.

### Usage üåüüåüüåü
We provide **two ways** to download MVImgNet:

#### 1. Directly download from SharePoint web interface. Then:
```
cd path/to/mvimgnet_zip_file
unzip './*.zip'
```
#### 2. We also provide the script at [download_tool.zip](https://github.com/GAP-LAB-CUHK-SZ/MVImgNet/blob/main/download_tool.zip). Usage: 
(Before using it, please make sure you have filled out our form and have received the password)
- Unzip the `download_tool.zip` using the password offered in [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfU9BkV1hY3r75n5rc37IvlzaK2VFYbdsvohqPGAjb2YWIbUg/viewform?usp=sf_link). The password provided in the form can be used to download data from the SharePoint web interface as well as to unzip the download tool.
- Choose the subfolder to download (e.g., [MVImgNet_origin, MVImgNet_category, MVImgNet_mask])
- Download with (e.g., using MVImgNet_origin):
```
python download_tool.py --data_name "MVImgNet_origin" --download_folder "/path/you/want/to/save"
```

#### üö© NOTE:
- We split the *full* data into 43 zip files (from mvi_00.zip to mvi_42.zip), and the total size is about 3.4 TB. If you need the *full* dataset, please directly download all `mvi_xx.zip`.
- If you just need *some categories* of the data, please download the corresponding categories at `MVImgNet_by_categories`, where we split the dataset into different categories (but it is *incomplete*, some categories are not included).

### Folder structure
```
|-- ROOT
    |-- class_label
        |-- instance_id
            |-- images
            |-- sparse/0
                |-- cameras.bin   # COLMAP reconstructed cameras
                |-- images.bin    # binary data of input images
                |-- points3D.bin  # COLMAP reconstructed sparse point cloud (not dense) 
```

The mapping between `class_label` and class name can be found in [mvimgnet_category.txt](https://github.com/GAP-LAB-CUHK-SZ/MVImgNet/blob/main/mvimgnet_category.txt).

The `images` folder contains the multi-view images, and the `sparse` folder contains the reconstructed camera parameters using COLMAP. It is recommended to use the functions provided by [COLMAP](https://github.com/colmap/colmap/blob/dev/scripts/python/read_write_model.py) to read the binary files under `sparse` folder. Moreover, the `gen_poses` function from [this repo](https://github.com/Fyusion/LLFF/tree/master/llff/poses) is recommended to convert the poses for NeRF training.

## MVPNet
MVPNet now contains 87,825 point clouds from 180 categories. Please fill out the following [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeZlpezgzmCufD94meHv-Pl_54RpNu2jZqMsyW2GCkVouyomQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) to download MVPNet.

## Demo
MVImgNet is also shown by Voxel51 at [here](https://cvpr.fiftyone.ai/datasets/mvimgnet/samples), which is publicly demo-able!
